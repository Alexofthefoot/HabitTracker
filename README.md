# Personal Organizer

This project began as a simple bullet journal companion but has since grown into a versatile, multifaceted tool. It is designed not only to keep track different areas of my daily life but also to serve as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills to future employers.

## Features
The application is a central hub for:

- Clothing Tracking: Manage a physical wardrobe, including records of cost-per-wear over time and the location of garments across multiple homes.
- Tarot Readings: Log readings, analyze patterns, and keep track of insights gained from tarot practice.
- Goal Setting & Progress Tracking: Work towards personal and professional goals while monitoring your progress.

## Learning Objectives
This project has been a valuable learning experience, particularly in:

- Front-End Development: Most of my academic background focused on small-scale backend projects and hypothetical situations. Developing this application has allowed me to expand my front-end skills significantly.
- Full-Stack Integration: By combining backend knowledge with new front-end tools, Iâ€™ve created a fully functional application.
- UI/UX Design: Learning how to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface has been both challenging and rewarding.
